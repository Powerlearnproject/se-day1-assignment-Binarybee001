Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles that mainly involve designing, development,deployment and maintenance of softwares.Through software engineering it solves the problem of making information, healthcare and aspects such as entertainment easier through the development of softawares.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages such as Fortan and C.
-Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
-The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements: It involves putting together and documenting the needs of the users and system requirements.
-Designing: Involves structuring high quality designs of the user interface and software architecture.
-Implementation: Involves creating of the software in accordance to the design that was agreed upon.
-Testing: It involves putting the software created into test to ensure that it functions properly being being deployed for public use.
-Deployment: Involves releasing the created software for public use.
-Maintenance: Involves updating of the software's in order to ensure that it functions properly and easier for the final user.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a software development methodology that mainly involves sequential approach with distinct phases flowing in a downward direction while Agile methodology mainly involves iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.Waterfall methodology is mainly used in large projects such as government and defense projects while agile is mainly used in smaller projects such as that of mobile app development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer: Incharge of writing the codes to be used enforce software solutions.
-Quality assurance engineer: Ensures that the developed softwares are of high quality by putting it into a thorough testing.
-Project Manager: Is incharge of the planning, executing and delivering of the software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a suitable environment in which the codes and tools of developing a software are writtten while VCS provide an environment in which the changes of a code can be tracked and also where various software developers can collaborate in creating a certain software. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing requirements: The requirements used for a software development may vary hence require changing which may cause delays. This can be solved by identifying the changes in advance hence reducing the time for their implementation.
-Tight Deadlines: Developing a software is a race against time especially in cases where a date is put in place which can lead to a developer creating a software full of bugs or of low quality. This can be solved by elongating the time required for the project and also encourage collaboration between various software developers hence reducing the work load of a single developer.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing: This is testing individual components of a computer. This ensures that the specific modules run as expected in the software.
-Integration testing: This tests the various interaction of different components in the software.Through this, a software developer ensures that the individual components work hand in hand ensuring proper running of the software.
-System testing: This is testing the whole software created as a whole. This ensures that the final product ie the software functions to serve the purpose it was created for.
-Acceptance Testing: This tests the software to ensure that it meets the user requirements as expected. This ensures that the software created is user friendly. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is basically the act of creating questions so as to obtain the best possible responses that an AI can put out.Through this it ensures that the AI understands clearly the question that it has been asked and it gives the best appropriate answer for the question.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague prompt: Tell me about means of transportation.
-Clear prompt: Tell me about the origin and history of land transportation.
Through this, it explains into detail on the means of transportation on the land began and how it has evolved to what it is today.
